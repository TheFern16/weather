// I have added a few extra features
  // Wind Direction, and Wind Speed
  // Min Temp
  // Max Temp
  // Heat Index converted to 'Feels Like'
  // Dew Point

// This was a conscious descision on my part.  I did a little bit of research.  I went to start.att.net.  I went to the weather page to take some notes on the features that ya'll provide to your customers.  All of the features that I have added to my page are present on your page.

// The 'feels like' feature took me the most time.  I did not have any experience with dewpoint, heat index, or kelvin temperature conversion prior to this test.  I really enjoyed the research, and implementation portion of this exam.

// I also experimented with seprating my code out into several different modules but the payoff was not very great.  In fact I felt like it made things less clear.  For this reason, I stuck with one single js file.

// the CSS reset is the only bit of code that I can't claim as entirely mine.  The heat index function was converted directly from the national weather service.  Aside from that, I wrote everything here.
